# IMPORTANT: Manual Model Installation for MSI Users

If you installed using the MSI installer and see "Model file not found" error:

1. Download the models separately from:
   https://github.com/vipulchaudhary/shakticore/releases/download/v1.0.0/models.zip

2. Extract models.zip

3. Copy the "models" folder to:
   C:\Program Files\shakticore-photo-restore\

4. Final structure should be:
   C:\Program Files\shakticore-photo-restore\
   ├── shakticore-photo-restore.exe
   └── models\
       ├── fast.onnx
       └── quality.onnx

5. Restart the app

OR

Use the portable version instead (recommended):
- No installation needed
- Models included
- Works immediately
