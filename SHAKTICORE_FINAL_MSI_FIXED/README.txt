SHAKTICORE PHOTO RESTORE v1.0 - FINAL RELEASE
==============================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ INSTALLATION OPTIONS CAREFULLY


RECOMMENDED: PORTABLE VERSION ✅
---------------------------------
Folder: portable\

WHY PORTABLE IS BETTER:
✅ Works immediately - no setup needed
✅ Models included and working
✅ No installation required
✅ No admin rights needed
✅ Run from anywhere (USB drives, etc.)
✅ Easy to update (just replace files)

INSTALLATION:
1. Extract "portable" folder to any location
   Example: D:\Apps\ShaktiCore\
2. Run shakticore-photo-restore.exe
3. Done! Start enhancing photos immediately.


ALTERNATIVE: MSI INSTALLER ⚠️
------------------------------
File: ShaktiCore-PhotoRestore-v1.0.msi

⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: The MSI installer has a model bundling issue.
   After installation, you must manually copy the models folder.

WHY WE RECOMMEND PORTABLE INSTEAD:
• MSI requires extra manual steps
• Portable version works perfectly out-of-the-box
• Most users prefer portable apps anyway

IF YOU MUST USE MSI:
1. Install ShaktiCore-PhotoRestore-v1.0.msi
2. Extract models.zip
3. Copy the "models" folder to:
   C:\Program Files\shakticore-photo-restore\
4. Final structure should be:
   C:\Program Files\shakticore-photo-restore\
   ├── shakticore-photo-restore.exe
   └── models\
       ├── fast.onnx
       └── quality.onnx
5. Launch from Start Menu

Note: This issue will be fixed in v1.1


FEATURES
--------
✅ AI Photo Enhancement (2x upscaling)
✅ Fast mode: 1-2 seconds per image
✅ Quality mode: 7-8 seconds per image
✅ 100% offline - no internet needed
✅ Drag & drop interface
✅ Quality protection (prevents over-processing)
✅ Batch processing (200+ images tested)
✅ Smart file filtering (skips already-enhanced files)


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
• Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
• 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
• 500MB free disk space


HOW TO USE
----------
1. Launch the app (portable or Start Menu)
2. Select Fast or Quality mode:
   • Fast: 1-2 seconds, good quality
   • Quality: 7-8 seconds, best results
3. Drag & drop a folder OR click to browse
4. Wait for processing
5. Find enhanced images with "_enhanced" suffix


BEST PRACTICES
--------------
✅ DO:
• Use original, unedited photos
• Process once with Quality mode
• Keep originals in separate folder
• Use portable version for best experience

❌ DON'T:
• Upscale already-upscaled images
• Process files larger than 10MB
• Rename enhanced files to bypass protection


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: "Model file not found" error?
A: Use the portable version instead of MSI.
   Or manually copy models folder (see MSI instructions above).

Q: App won't start?
A: Run as administrator. Check Windows Defender didn't block it.

Q: Slow processing?
A: Use Fast mode for batches. Quality mode is for important photos.

Q: Files being skipped?
A: Files >10MB or with "_enhanced" in name are skipped automatically.
   This protects quality. Use original source files.
